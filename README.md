Here are some use cases (expectations about your project):

    Added functions for the following items:
    - add
    - subtract
    - multiply
    - divide


    Created a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit and operator:
    - numbers
    - dot
    - clear
    - delete
    - +, -, *, /, =

    Created the functions to
    - match btn click and value
    - allow entering only digits and operators
       

        Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data. Make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”.

    Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo their last input if they click the wrong number.
